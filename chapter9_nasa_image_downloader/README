You need ObjectListView for this application to work:

https://pypi.org/project/ObjectListView/

pip install ObjectListView

You also need requests:

https://pypi.org/project/requests/

pip install requests

Finally, you will need pubsub:

https://pypi.org/project/PyPubSub

pip install pypubsub

In python 3.x environments (like Ubuntu 20.04), use 'pip3' instead of 'pip' 
in the above.
