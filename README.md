# Creating GUI Applications with wxPython

This is the code repository for the book, Creating GUI Applications with wxPython by Michael Driscoll

## Audience
This book is for intermediate level developers who would like to learn how to create cross-platform graphical user interfaces with the Python programming language. It would be helpful if you knew the basics of the **wxPython** package, but that is not a requirement.

## What You Need for the Book
You will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and [wxPython 4](https://wxpython.org/). Some examples also use the [ObjectListView](https://pypi.org/project/ObjectListView/) widget.

He is the author of the popular Python blog, [The Mouse Vs. the Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/) as well as several other Python books including **Python 101**, **Python Interviews** and **ReportLab - PDF Processing with Python**.
